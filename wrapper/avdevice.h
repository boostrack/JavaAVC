/**
 * @defgroup lavd Special devices muxing/demuxing library
 * @{
 * Libavdevice is a complementary library to @ref libavf "libavformat". It
 * provides various "special" platform-specific muxers and demuxers, e.g. for
 * grabbing devices, audio capture and playback etc. As a consequence, the
 * (de)muxers in libavdevice are of the AVFMT_NOFILE type (they use their own
 * I/O functions). The filename passed to avformat_open_input() often does not
 * refer to an actually existing file, but has some special device-specific
 * meaning - e.g. for x11grab it is the display name.
 *
 * To use libavdevice, simply call avdevice_register_all() to register all
 * compiled muxers and demuxers. They all use standard libavformat API.
